# LaunchDarkly Agent Skills

LaunchDarkly's public collection of AI agent skills and playbooks. These skills encode repeatable workflows for working with LaunchDarkly, so coding agents can execute common tasks safely and consistently.

## What Is This Repo?

Agent Skills are modular, text-based playbooks that teach an agent how to perform a workflow. This repo is designed to be a public, open-source home for LaunchDarkly skills and to align with the emerging Agent Skills Open Standard.

## Quick Start (Local)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/launchdarkly/agent-skills.git
cd agent-skills

# If your agent supports skills.sh installs:
npx skills add launchdarkly/agent-skills

# Or manually copy a skill into your agent's skills path:
cp -r skills/feature-flags/launchdarkly-flag-cleanup <your-agent-skills-dir>/
```

Then ask your agent something like:

```
Which feature flags are stale and should be cleaned up?
```

```
Create a feature flag for the new checkout flow
```

```
Roll out dark-mode to 25% of users in production
```

```
Remove the `new-checkout-flow` feature flag from this codebase
```

## Install via skills.sh CLI

```bash
npx skills add <owner/repo>
```
